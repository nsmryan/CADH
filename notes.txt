

Features:
  take config (probably json) describing datatype
    consider files for each type with a way to distinguish themFF
    ideally these get placed in a sum type

  write/read file or socket depending on config file
    ideally can choose tcp or udp

  enums

  calibrated values

  profiling

  criterion

  unit tests/property tests

  logging-
    expected values not met
    limits exceeded
    checksum/crc errors
    bad packet Hex lines

  Map to HashMap? Maybe look at when criterion is set up


Questions:
  is there a fundemental distinction between a static type for manipulating
    data internally like Record f '[], and parsing/decoding from a
    type that describes possible structures
    where is the commonality and where are the difference, and should they
    be combined or left separate

  need to add functions/application specific code and have a mainWith
    potentially in case there is complexity to decoding packets,
    like with SPOCUtils


Data Types:

products:
  fixed vs var
  sequence type
  parallel product type- session type analogy

sums:
  pad vs pack

exponents:
  map from indices or enum to data
